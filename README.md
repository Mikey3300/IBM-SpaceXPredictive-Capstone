# IBM SpaceX Predictive Capstone

### Course Project	 

- Worked individually in task of predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. 

### Assumption

- **Role:** Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders. 

- **The main task:** Predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.
-------------------------------------------
### Stages

There are 6 phases to sum up my capstone:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Wrangling
3. EDA using SQL
4. EDA with Visualization
5. Visualization with Dash
6. Machine Learning 

### SHORT Recommendation from SpaceX Predictive Model

- Using KNN and SVM models due to their highest accuracy of futuristic successful landing
